# JavaFXHotel

## Presentation
  I share with you the automation that I prepared with JavaFX, a technology of Java. It is a basic automation in which the user can become a member and make a reservation before going to the hotel, have information about the rooms and get information about the price, and where the members can renew their forgotten passwords with a matching security question. In the management panel, I prepared an automation where hotel staff can be added to the system, can make arrangements about the staff, view the registered members, change information about the members with their requests, update the reservations created and cancel the reservations.
## Technologies and Poles Used
  While preparing this automation, I used MySql, which is one of the database systems needed to keep data, and I preferred XAMPP Control Panel for the intermediate program. I used a secure system for passwords using the MD5 encryption method, while the passwords of the members and admins were recorded in the database using security and math libraries. For the design, I made the objects used (eg TextField, Button, DateTime, Background Color) suitable for the eye by color matching with various CSS codes.
